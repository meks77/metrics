The Microprofile Standard before Release 3.0 for Metrics(until 1.3) is net very good usable with Prometheus and Grafana. The feature with lables isn't usable well.

The Metrics Standard for Release 2+ has very usefull changes, but there is no ApplicationServer or MicroProfileServer which implements the new standard.

Therefor this lib is born, to start having usefull metrics in applications using JEE7, JEE8 and/or in MicroProfile 3.0, and easily migrate to Server-Implementations using a newer MicroProfile Standard(3.+)
